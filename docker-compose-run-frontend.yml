# this docker configuation is the prod flavor, 
# it is supposed that your declared some ENV variables:
#   - ${FRONTEND} points to matchID-frontend (from GitHub, branch 'master')
#   - ${PROJECTS} points to your projects path
#   - ${UPLOAD} points to your upload path
# it only differs from the dev that the code isn't accessible and the frontend code is compiled

# for production use many adaptation still be needed if you use docker
# - assume you docker images with a custom managed repo
# - securize nginx routes allowing only stricly needed routes of API
# - build the static files from node frontend and put them to the nginx
# - build a cluster for elasticsearch
# - use real volumes : S3-like storage for configurations (using volumes) of front and back,
#   and DB-storage for ES volume like SSD volumes (or memory storage still better)
